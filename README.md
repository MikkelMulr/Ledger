Ledger

What is it?

Ledger is a simple expense tracking application that I created initially for my own use (it was very basic and not terribly fun to look at).
I needed something like this because I found myself surrounded by sticky notes and reminders of things that I needed to keep and eye on, it got out of hand.

Eventually I chose to refactor the whole thing and polish it up into something actually fun to use, maybe someone else could use it too, not this is unique by any measure.


The project is built in React and I used Sass for my CSS, because at this point writing vanilla css feels almost too weird.


Current Version 1.0

- The project at the moment is still being built and updated with the front-end nearing the final stages in terms of styling and overall component layout.
- Upcoming plans are to build out the backend, including registration/ loging and a database to house user data (such as various expenses by month).

- Potential future plans are to build a stand alone mobile version (TDB).
